## Experiment Design

The experiment design that I chose to go with is focusing mainly on the data container size and whether or not the time difference is noticeable when changing the size of the container and also in reference to whether or not the selected number will exceed or not exceed the maximum in the container. Our experiment was designed as such. First, we would run the program as a --exceed command, which means that the number, which is randomly generated by the program, is going to be over the maximum value that was originally set for the container. For the purposes of this lab, I set the maximum value as the suggested 50,000,000. We run the --exceed command and use the data container called a list with the container value being 5000. Then we would run this same command again but with the data container being 10,000, and another time with it being 20,000. Then we would do the exact same thing with the set and tuple data containers and compare whether or not having a different size container mattered for each data container. Then we would use that to see which container is the fastest/most efficient when pertaining to the --exceed value. The experiment will also do the same thing but with a value that does not exceed the maximum. This is useful because it allows us to see the difference in time it takes for the computer to run through the who data container, as it would when using --exceed, versus taking its chances and trying to find a number that should be in the data container. That was the set up of the experiment that I decided to do.

## Research Questions

- RQ 1: How does the size of the container effect the run time of the program when the number being searched for doesn't exceed the maximum value? Look at a small container size of 5,000, a medium container size of 10,000, and a large container size of 20,000. Compare this by running with a list, set, and tuple.

- RQ 2: How does the size of the container effect the run time of the program when the number being searched for exceeds the maximum value(also consider this when talking about running for a list, set, and tuple)? Look at a small container size of 5,000, a medium container size of 10,000, and a large container size of 20,000.

- RQ 3: How does the size of the maximum value effect the run time of the program when the number being searched for exceeds the maximum value? Look at a small maximum value of 1,000,000 and a large maximum value of 100,000,000. Compare this by running with a list, set, and tuple.

## Performance Analysis

### Empirical Evaluation

Provide at least three paragraphs that explain which containment checking
algorithm is fastest, by how much it is faster, and how you knew that it was
faster, referencing the data in the aforementioned command outputs and the data
tables to support your response. You should make sure that you answer each of
the at least three research questions that you posed in a previous section.

Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain configurations are faster!
It is not sufficient to ONLY explain WHICH configuration is faster!

### Analytical Evaluation

Using the provided source code for the different containment check
algorithms, your textbook, your experimental results, and any relevant online
resources that you cite in this reflection, define the worst-case time
complexity, using the big-O notation, for the three containment check
algorithms called `containment_check_tuple`, `containment_check_list`, and
`containment_check_set`. You should justify why you picked that complexity.

## Source Code

### Describe in detail how the provided source code works

```python
number_runs = 10
number_repeats = 3
execution_times = timeit.Timer(containment_check_lambda).repeat(
    repeat=number_repeats, number=number_runs
```

This source code is telling the computer that it needs to run the program 10 times for each repeat and then repeat through that another three times. This is shown in lines one and two of the example. The code is also telling the computer that it needs to time each run using the timeit.Timer part of the code which is a python import. This import allows the data to be collected while the program is running and will eventually be displayable through the cli function in the main.py file. The execution_times variable is very useful because it also allows the timer to collect data based on the repeates and then display the average times so that we dont have 30 different times printed at the output.

## Professional Development

### What is challenging about designing an experiment to evaluate an algorithm's performance?

I think the most challenging thing about designing an experiment is that you have to think about the output that you have to understand what you are trying to accomplish (along with the code you wrote) so well that you can develop a question to answer that is attainable for the code you wrote, as well as is something that the code doesnt already tell you. My biggest struggle with developing/designing my experiment was that I didnt, at first, have enough foundational knowledge of what each peice of code was doing and how the experiment should function to give me an answer to the questions I was trying to develop. At first I didnt quite understand what it meant for the program value to "exceed" or "not exceed" the maximum and that made it especially tricky to try and develop a question revolving around that.

### Why is it necessary to perform both an analytical and an empirical evaluation of an algorithm?

I think it is necessary to do this because you can't always rely on the code to tell you everything you need to know through just the output. I think knowing how to deduce things from the code you have written is exceedingly important and being able to draw conclusions without seeing an output can be very helpful becuase it can not only give you more backing for your answers but it can also tell you when your output for the code may have gone awry.

Similarly I think that running empirical evaluations of code can be just as important because getting an ouput can also be one of the best ways to run an experiment and get the data you need to answer important/difficult questions.

### How do the empirical results suggest that you don't yet know the entire story about the performance of containment checking?

Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.
