## Experiment Design

The experiment design that I chose to go with is focusing mainly on the data container size and whether or not the time difference is noticeable when changing the size of the container and also in reference to whether or not the selected number will exceed or not exceed the maximum in the container. Our experiment was designed as such. First, we would run the program as a --exceed command, which means that the number, which is randomly generated by the program, is going to be over the maximum value that was originally set for the container. For the purposes of this lab, I set the maximum value as the suggested 50,000,000. We run the --exceed command and use the data container called a list with the container value being 5000. Then we would run this same command again but with the data container being 10,000, and another time with it being 20,000. Then we would do the exact same thing with the set and tuple data containers and compare whether or not having a different size container mattered for each data container. Then we would use that to see which container is the fastest/most efficient when pertaining to the --exceed value. The experiment will also do the same thing but with a value that does not exceed the maximum. This is useful because it allows us to see the difference in time it takes for the computer to run through the who data container, as it would when using --exceed, versus taking its chances and trying to find a number that should be in the data container. That was the set up of the experiment that I decided to do.

## Research Questions

- RQ 1: How does the size of the container effect the run time of the program when the number being searched for doesn't exceed the maximum value (also consider this when talking about running for a list, set, and tuple)?

- RQ 2: How does the size of the container effect the run time of the program when the number being searched for exceeds the maximum value(also consider this when talking about running for a list, set, and tuple)?

- RQ 3: Which data container is the fastes when searching for a value that exceeds the maximum value in any container size?

## Performance Analysis

### Empirical Evaluation

TODO: Provide at least three paragraphs that explain which containment checking
algorithm is fastest, by how much it is faster, and how you knew that it was
faster, referencing the data in the aforementioned command outputs and the data
tables to support your response. You should make sure that you answer each of
the at least three research questions that you posed in a previous section.

TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain configurations are faster!
TODO: It is not sufficient to ONLY explain WHICH configuration is faster!

### Analytical Evaluation

TODO: Using the provided source code for the different containment check
algorithms, your textbook, your experimental results, and any relevant online
resources that you cite in this reflection, define the worst-case time
complexity, using the big-O notation, for the three containment check
algorithms called `containment_check_tuple`, `containment_check_list`, and
`containment_check_set`. You should justify why you picked that complexity.
